## Description
The files in this repository create a Team Profile Generator. It operates on the node.js runtime and utilizes the inquire.js package to interface with users. The user will be asked questions regarding a team of employees and at the end will be presented with a generated HTML file to display the profile of the team. The jest.js package is also used to run unit tests to validate the functionality of the Team Profile Generator.
